# Yet-Another-Single-Select (YASS)
Yet another dropdown single-select component for React (What, like we didn't have enough?)

## Website / Demo
See this component in action!

## Motivation
When someone asks you to roll your own react-select, you do it.

... okay, so it turns out that a lot of places want you to know how to code using React, so it helps to actually do a project in React.
## Usage
... You want to include a dropdown on your form? ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯

## Planned Features / Improvements
(Read: things I know I left out of this version but I'm hoping to learn a thing and get them in there sooner or later)
- Improved functionality with React Hooks (once I get a better grasp of those)
- making the currently selected value distinguished from the others
- changing the color of the selected value once someone actually selects a thing
