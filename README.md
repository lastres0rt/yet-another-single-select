# Yet-Another-Single-Select (YASS)
Yet another dropdown single-select component for React (What, like we didn't have enough?)

## Installation

## Website / Demo
See this component in action!

## Motivation
When someone asks you to roll your own react-select, you do it.

... okay, so it turns out that a lot of places want you to know how to code using React, so it helps to actually do a project in React.
## Usage
¯\_(ツ)_/¯
## Help and Contributions

 If you're seeing this (and I haven't bothered to update the readme), I'm probably either looking for a job and could use a nice heap of training to get/keep my next one.
